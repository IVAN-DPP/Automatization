      <h2>SortInDirs</h2>
      <p>If you want sort a directory with messy files like to the directory Downloads into other directories, it process can be useful for you.</p>
      <p>The idea is that in the file <em>sort.cpp</em> you create a object of <em>Sort</em> and after create the file, or tell to the program that in this directory you want move all the files with some extention, I put the an example of this:</p>
      <img alt="SortDirs" src="./Images/SortDirs" align="center"/>
      <p>This example say, please, open the directory "Descargas", after, create or define the directory "Fotos" and finally save in this directory the files with extentions "jpg" "png" etc</p>
